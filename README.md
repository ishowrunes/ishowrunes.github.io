Senior Mobile Engineer building professional mobile apps that scale

I design, build, and evolve high-quality mobile applications — from idea to production and beyond.

I’m Ishwor Shrestha, a Senior / Principal Mobile Engineer with 10+ years of experience building and leading mobile applications used at scale. My focus is on creating reliable, maintainable, and production-ready mobile apps that support long-term growth.

I’m open to mobile app projects, contract engagements, and full-time opportunities.

2> About

==================================================
ABOUT ME
==================================================

I’m a mobile engineer who enjoys turning ideas into well-engineered products.

Over the last decade, I’ve worked across startups and high-growth companies, contributing not just code but technical direction, architectural thinking, and team leadership. I’ve been closely involved in decisions around app structure, performance, release processes, and developer workflows — always with an eye on long-term maintainability.

My work spans the full lifecycle of mobile apps:
- Designing architectures that scale with teams and features
- Building clean, testable, and well-structured codebases
- Improving existing systems to be easier to extend and maintain
- Supporting teams with clear standards, reviews, and mentorship

I value thoughtful engineering over shortcuts and believe great mobile apps come from strong fundamentals, practical trade-offs, and clear communication.
